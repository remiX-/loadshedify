# loadshedify

loadshedify is a Discord Bot that consumes EskomSePush Business API v2.0 for the Build Challenge as well as Discord API to send messages inside of a Discord Server.

## Overview

This bot uses Serverless Infrastructure hosted in AWS. This is done with AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).

A quick breakdown of this project:

- Makefile - local script to get everything up and running, essentially mimicing what CI/CD would do in a real world scenario
- template.yaml - Infrastructure as Code using AWS SAM & CloudFormation
- src/Proxy - .NET Projects housing Lambda Functions which can be seen as the 'Bot Commands', i.e. `/help`
- src/scripts - Some scripts to tie everything together (dev & live things)

## Tools & CLI

  - NOTE DOWN the `APPLICATION ID`, `PUBLIC KEY` and `BOT TOKEN` (under **Bot**)

## Setup

### AWS

Once you have all the Tools & CLIs installed. Lets setup a an IAM user quick as we need access to AWS resources.

Please follow this guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html. For purposes of quickness, the user can just have admin access.

Once you have that you can continue. Try run `aws iam list-users` to see if it's connecting. You should see at least your user you just created, for example my `loadshedify-dev`:

### Discord

- Create an Applcation under Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
  - Can name it whatever, this will be the name of your Discord Bot
- Note down the **APPLICATION_ID** and **PUBLIC_KEY**, for eg:
  - **APPLICATION_ID** = 1031614407991623710
  - **PUBLIC_KEY** = e6d00f15af414e06f07ad21ef9668f1292e0611647e946de664257df59f33e48
- From the application, head to **Bot** section in the left navigation
  - Click "Add Bot"
  - **NOTE:** If you have a generic name like 'test' that is used a lot, you'll get an error. Go back to **General Information** to change the name
  - Now that this application has a Bot assigned to it, you'll need to get the **BOT_TOKEN**
  - Click the "Reset Token" and note down **BOT_TOKEN**, for eg:
    - **BOT_TOKEN** = MTAzMTYxNDQwNzk5MTYyMzcxMA.GikmU9.JbGHdEID3LxNzvtDI7n3NR2NH2PCgTw1McwD8Y
    - **NOTE:** This value is only shown once, if you forget to copy / lose it you can reset it and retrieve a new one
- Now head to **OAuth2 -> URL Generator**, add:
  - Scopes: `applications.command`, `bot`
  - Bot Permissions (pops up when you tick `bot` as per above): `Send Messages`, `Use Slash Commands`
  - **Copy the url at the bottom and paste in a new tab**

### Creating the Infrastructure

Now that AWS and Discord Bot should be setup, we are close the being complete with the setup.

The only thing that remains should be quite painless which is just running the Infrastructure as Code:

- `yarn` / `npm install`
- make all

This should setup the entire infrastructure
